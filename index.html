              The GMAT exam is adaptable in nature, which means it adapts to the
              test taker's ability level based on their answers to previous
              questions. The tablet prepares the candidates for the real-time
              situation in GMAT exam.

            <li>
              The traditional approach to GMAT preparation won't yield the
              results you want. GMAT is a smart exam and thus requires smart
              preparation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The leading institutes typically offer 60-70 hours of classes for
              both quant and verbal, with 30 hours for quant and 30 hours for
              verbal.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are around 15 quant topics covered in those 30 hours of
              quant. The math says that each concept, such as algebra, geometry,
              arithmetic, will take 2 hours each to learn.

            <li>
              Time constraints make it difficult for a teacher to teach from the
